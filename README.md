1. Evaluate the sum:  
2. Use the definition of the definite integral as a limit of a Riemann sum to evaluate the area under the graph of f (x) = x2 - 1 in the first quadrant between x = 1 and x = 3. You must take sample points to be the right endpoint of each subinterval. Here are some useful summation formulae:

3. Use Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find g'(0) if  
4. The velocity function (in meters per second) for a particle moving along a straight line isgiven by v(t) = t2 - 4 . Find the distance travelled in the time interval 0 ≤ t 代 写MATH 116 CALCULUS II Midterm 1

5. Evaluate the integral  dx by interpreting it in terms of areas.
6. Evalutate the integrals:
(a) 
(b) 
(c) 
(d)  In(sin x)cot x dx
7. Find the area of the region R bounded by the curves y2 = 3 - x and x = 2y.
8. Consider the region R in the first quadrant of the plane bounded by the curves  x = 0, and y = 0.
(a) Use the disk/washer method to find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region R about the line y = -1.
(b) Use the method of cylindrical shells to find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating the region R about the line x = 4 .
